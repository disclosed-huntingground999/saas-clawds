  Your SaaS playbook is ready. Here's what to do next:

  1. Browse each department folder and read the INSTRUCTIONS.md files
  2. Use an AI agent to help you fill out the detailed documents:

     Tell your agent:
     "Read AGENTS.md and help me populate the remaining folders
      for {profile['name']}."

  3. Review and customize all generated content
  4. Commit your personalized playbook to your own private repo
